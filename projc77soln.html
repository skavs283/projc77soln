        <p>Visual studio has many extensions
            and libraries that will help us learn
            javascript in a much better way. </p>
            <p>
               Installed the Visual Studio code, add a live server to it.
               Live server will help us to run the code in real time exactly like Live
               Preview in Brackets.
